# Healthcare Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
The Healthcare Disease Prediction project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting various diseases based on patient data. This project utilizes several datasets to train and evaluate models, providing insights into healthcare analytics.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains all datasets used in the project.
  - **raw/**: Original datasets used for the project.
  - **processed/**: Cleaned and preprocessed datasets ready for analysis.
  - **external/**: External data sources that complement the primary datasets.
  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project.
  - **01_eda.ipynb**: Exploratory Data Analysis.
  - **02_preprocessing.ipynb**: Data preprocessing steps.
  - **03_modeling.ipynb**: Building and training machine learning models.
  - **04_evaluation.ipynb**: Evaluating model performance.

- **src/**: Source code for the project.
  - **data/**: Scripts for loading and preprocessing data.
  - **features/**: Scripts for feature engineering and selection.
  - **models/**: Implementations of machine learning models and training routines.
  - **visualization/**: Utility scripts for creating visualizations and plots.

- **models/**: Directory for saving trained machine learning models.

- **reports/**: Generated analysis reports, including findings and visualizations.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd healthcare-disease-prediction
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv healthcare-ml-env
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     ```
     healthcare-ml-env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - MacOS/Linux:
     ```
     source healthcare-ml-env/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data, preprocess it, build models, and evaluate their performance.
- The source code in the `src/` directory can be modified for custom data processing and model training routines.
- Save trained models in the `models/` directory for future use.
